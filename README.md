This is a repository for code written by Ben Southwick and Massimo Fontaine. It pertains to our computer science project monitoring foot traffic at Colby College, Maine. 
Code from version 1 of the project, which used Python scripts to share pings over local Wi-Fi can be found in the DeprecatedCode folder.
Code from version 2, which uses (and is currently running on) the Arduino IoT Cloud to share pings over the Internet can be found in the LiveCode folder.

Acknowledgments: Thank you to Daniel Tarkoff and Sameer Khan for their assistance with using the Arduino IoT. Massive thanks to Professor Ying Li for her guidance and patience.
